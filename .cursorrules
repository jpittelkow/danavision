# DanaVision Development Guidelines

This file defines critical rules that MUST be followed when making changes to DanaVision.

---

## STOP: Read This First

Before writing ANY code, understand these requirements. Changes will be rejected if not met.

### Quick Checklist

- [ ] Containers are running - Check Docker containers first
- [ ] Tests are written - Every feature/bugfix requires tests
- [ ] Tests pass - Run full test suite before completion
- [ ] E2E tests pass - Frontend features require Playwright tests
- [ ] ADR created - If this is a significant architectural change
- [ ] Documentation updated - TypeScript types, API docs if needed

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Containerized Development Environment

**This project runs ENTIRELY in Docker containers. NOTHING runs locally on the host machine.**

### Before Running ANY Command

1. **Check that containers are running first:**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

2. **If containers are not running, start them:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Running Commands

All commands (tests, artisan, npm, composer, etc.) MUST be executed inside containers:

```bash
# Backend commands (PHP/Laravel)
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker compose exec app ./vendor/bin/pest
docker compose exec app composer install

# Frontend commands (Node/npm)
docker compose exec app npm install
docker compose exec app npm run dev
docker compose exec app npm run test:e2e

# Database access
docker compose exec db mysql -u root -p
```

### NEVER Do This

```bash
# WRONG - These will fail or affect wrong environment
php artisan migrate          # No local PHP
./vendor/bin/pest           # No local vendor
npm install                 # Wrong node_modules location
composer install            # No local composer
```

### Common Container Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f app

# Restart containers
docker compose restart

# Rebuild containers (after Dockerfile changes)
docker compose up -d --build

# Shell into container
docker compose exec app bash
```

---

## Mandatory Requirements

### 1. Tests Are Required

EVERY new feature, bug fix, or change MUST include tests. No exceptions.

| Change Type | Backend Test | E2E Test | Required |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| New page | Pest PHP feature test | Playwright spec | Always |
| New API endpoint | Pest PHP feature test | If UI uses it | Always |
| Bug fix | Regression test | If UI affected | Always |
| New component | - | Playwright if interactive | Always |
| AI/Service change | Pest PHP unit test | - | Always |

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests (Pest PHP) - run inside container
docker compose exec app ./vendor/bin/pest

# E2E tests (Playwright) - requires app running
docker compose exec app npm run test:e2e

# E2E with UI mode (debugging)
docker compose exec app npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### 2. Frontend Testing with Playwright

ALL new frontend features MUST have E2E tests before being considered complete.

- Tests live in `backend/e2e/`
- Use `auth.setup.ts` for authenticated tests
- Test both desktop and mobile viewports
- Cover happy path and error states

### 3. User-Based Data Isolation

All data is scoped to the authenticated user. Users can ONLY access their own data.

**Required Patterns:**

```php
// CORRECT - Filter by authenticated user
$lists = ShoppingList::where('user_id', $request->user()->id)->get();

// WRONG - Never return all records
$lists = ShoppingList::all(); // SECURITY VULNERABILITY!
```

**Policy Authorization:**

```php
// CORRECT - Always authorize with policy
public function show(ShoppingList $list)
{
    $this->authorize('view', $list);
    // ...
}

// WRONG - Never skip authorization
public function show(ShoppingList $list)
{
    return $list; // Any user can view any list!
}
```

### 4. API Contract Synchronization

These files MUST stay synchronized:

1. `backend/resources/js/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
2. `backend/app/Http/Resources/*.php` - API Resources (if used)
3. `backend/app/Http/Controllers/*Controller.php` - Controller responses

When adding a new field:
1. Add column to migration
2. Add to model's `$fillable`
3. Add to controller response
4. Add to TypeScript interface

### 5. ADRs for Significant Changes

ADRs MUST be written for:
- New features with new patterns
- Database schema changes
- Authentication/authorization changes
- New external integrations
- AI system changes
- Infrastructure changes

## Code Patterns

### Controller Actions

```php
// Index - filter by user
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $items = ShoppingList::where('user_id', $request->user()->id)->get();
    return Inertia::render('Lists/Index', ['lists' => $items]);
}

// Store - set user_id from auth
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validated = $request->validate([...]);
    $list = ShoppingList::create([
        'user_id' => $request->user()->id,
        ...$validated,
    ]);
    return redirect()->route('lists.show', $list);
}

// Show/Update/Delete - authorize with policy
public function show(ShoppingList $list)
{
    $this->authorize('view', $list);
    return Inertia::render('Lists/Show', ['list' => $list]);
}
```

### Policy Pattern

```php
class ShoppingListPolicy
{
    public function view(User $user, ShoppingList $list): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $list->user_id;
    }

    public function update(User $user, ShoppingList $list): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $list->user_id;
    }
}
```

### Inertia.js Patterns

```tsx
// Page component with typed props
interface Props extends PageProps {
  list: ShoppingList;
  can_edit: boolean;
}

export default function ListShow({ auth, list, can_edit, flash }: Props) {
  const { data, setData, post, processing } = useForm({
    product_name: '',
  });

  const submit = (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    post(`/lists/${list.id}/items`);
  };

  return (
    <AppLayout auth={auth} flash={flash}>
      {/* ... */}
    </AppLayout>
  );
}
```

## Pre-Completion Checklist

Before marking ANY feature as complete:

1. [ ] Containers running: `docker compose ps`
2. [ ] Backend tests pass: `docker compose exec app ./vendor/bin/pest`
3. [ ] E2E tests pass: `docker compose exec app npm run test:e2e`
4. [ ] New features have E2E tests in `backend/e2e/`
5. [ ] TypeScript types updated if API changed
6. [ ] No console.log/debug statements left
7. [ ] Error handling uses proper messages
8. [ ] Loading states handled in UI

---

## Testing New Features

When implementing a new feature:

1. Verify containers are running: `docker compose ps`
2. Write the backend code
3. Write Pest PHP tests for the controller/service
4. Write the frontend React component
5. Write Playwright E2E tests
6. Run all tests (inside container): `docker compose exec app ./vendor/bin/pest`
7. Fix any failures
8. Feature is complete only when ALL tests pass

---

## Questions?

1. Are containers running? `docker compose ps`
2. Check if the pattern exists elsewhere in the codebase
3. Look for user_id filtering pattern
4. Verify Policy authorization is in place
5. Run tests - they catch many issues
